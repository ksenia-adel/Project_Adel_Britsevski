---

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```


Create a .env file inside /backend:

```bash
PORT=3001
DB_HOST=dev.vk.edu.ee
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=xxx
DB_USER=xxx
DB_PASSWORD=xxx
DB_DIALECT=postgres
DB_SCHEMA=onlinedoc
JWT_SECRET=xxx
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/onlinedoc_logs
```
Start the server:

```bash
node app.js
```

## MongoDB Integration

This project uses **MongoDB** alongside PostgreSQL to store system activity logs in a flexible, scalable NoSQL format.

Each time a patient creates a booking, a log entry is saved in MongoDB, containing:
- Action name (e.g. "Booking created")
- Patient email
- Schedule ID
- Doctor ID
- Timestamp

This makes it easy to analyze actions and keep historical records without overloading the main relational database.

MongoDB is connected using Mongoose and initialized on server startup.

To run MongoDB locally:
1. Install MongoDB Compass[(https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
2. Add new connection mongodb://localhost:27017
3. Open the onlinedoc_logs database
4. View the logs collection to see real-time actions from the app
